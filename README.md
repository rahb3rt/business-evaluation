# DCF Analysis for Landscaping Business

This is a simple Python program that performs a discounted cash flow (DCF) analysis for a landscaping business. The program calculates the estimated business value based on net profit, growth rate, discount rate, and the number of years considered for analysis.

## How to Use

1. Install Python 3.x on your system if you haven't already. You can download it from https://www.python.org/downloads/.
2. Copy the Python program code provided above and save it as a file with the extension ".py" (for example, `dcf_analysis.py`).
3. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the folder containing the `dcf_analysis.py` file.
4. Run the following command: `python dcf_analysis.py`
5. The estimated business value will be displayed in the terminal.

## Customization

To customize the analysis, you can modify the input values in the Python program:

- `net_profit`: The net profit of the landscaping business in the base year.
- `growth_rate`: The growth rate of net profit during the first 5 years.
- `discount_rate`: The discount rate used to calculate the present value of future cash flows.
- `num_years`: The number of years considered for the DCF analysis.
- `growth_rate_after_5_years`: The growth rate of net profit after the first 5 years.

Update the values as needed and rerun the program to perform the DCF analysis based on the new inputs.

## Disclaimer

Please note that the DCF analysis performed by this program is based on several assumptions, and the results should be considered as rough estimates. It's recommended to consult with a financial professional for a more accurate valuation of your specific business.
